#### Hello Team! I appreciate your time and consideration for the opportunity !

#### To start each application, refer to each directory's (node_backend, react_frontend) README.md

### but in short cd into each directory in separate terminals and run `npm start`

### PS I also wrote tests `npm test` in each directory

#### Please reach out with any questions, Best Gino Trombetti !
