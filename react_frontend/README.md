#### Hello Team, I appreciate your time and consideration for the opportunity ! This is the front end for the case study. The application should be self-explanatory but when the application is running simply add a CC number to the input and click validate !

#### You will either get a valid or invalid CC response from the backend service

## It is imperative that the node server is turned on first before starting this application

#### Do this by opening a terminal within the node_backend directory and using `npm start`

#### the React application is listening to port 3100

### To start use `npm start`

#### This will start the application at localhost:3000

### You can also run `npm test` to run the tests I created

#### Please Reach out with any questions !! Best GT (:
